<h3>Entries management</h3>
The core of this very simple CMS. Entries will help you informing your visitors constantly. An entry can have multiple tags and be marked as important.

<h3>Tags management</h3>
A very basic model that will help you describing your entries.

<h3>Important Entries management</h3>
If you want to make an entry stand out from the rest this is what you need. Marking and entry as important will make it appear as a diapositive in the carousel that is displayed in all blog views. Keep in mind that the carousel is only displayed in tablet and desktop screen sizes.
